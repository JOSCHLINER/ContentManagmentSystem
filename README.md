# Goal and Ambitions
My goal with this project is to have a working Markdown Content Management System. It should be easy to use and not too complicated.
It also should be a silo application meaning all content is created on the server side as I want to improve my skills in Object Oriented Programming.

# Roadmap
As outlined below is my roadmap for this project. This is not a timed roadmap a progress-based roadmap divided into stages.

- ***First Release:*** *(finishing)*

  In this first release, I just want to get something working out, a minimally viable product. In this phase, I want to try writing a stable backend with clean code on which I can later build. The front end is not a priority and just has to do the job.
  That means that styling as well as proper HTML structures are not something I care much about at the moment, as they can easily be implemented later on when I have come up with a proper design.
  The tasks required to reach this milestone are the following:
  - [ ] admin panel
  - [ ] create and view Pages
  - [ ] very simple user system
  - [ ] basic documentation

- ***Frontend cleanup*** *(in progress)*

  In this phase, I want to create a satisfying interface for the user. My main focus will be to create a design for the page and to create proper HTML structures with my PHP output.
  The tasks required to reach this milestone are the following:
  - [ ] User-facing interface
  - [ ] Admin Panel usability - make items more readable and make a better UI
 
- ***Performance***
  
  In this stage, I want to try to make the page more performant using [Redis](https://redis.io/) as a server-side caching mechanism. I will also try looking into other methods for improving the performance of the server like indexing.
  The tasks required to reach this milestone are the following:
  - [ ] Implement Redis
  - [ ] possibly implementing other performance-enhancing methods
 
After these initial milestones, the goal will be to improve the site as a whole. This mostly means implementing features like search, comments, as well as moderation.
